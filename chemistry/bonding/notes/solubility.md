# Solubility
In secondary school, we memorize solubility rules without really understanding why. Even post-secondary, some of us chemistry students still don't know what makes an ionic compound soluble. In this set of notes, I aim to provide a physical and chemical basis for the rules of solubility of ionic compounds.
## Coulomb's Law
![](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1594356158/render.png), where q is the charge and r is the radius of an electrostatically charged object, and where k is a constant.  

This is Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law describes the force of attraction (or repulsion) between two electrostatically charged objects, like ions or electrodes. You might notice that this is quite similar to the the lattice energy equation:  
![](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%7C%5Ctext%7BLattice%20Energy%7D%7C%20%5Cpropto%20%5Cfrac%7Bq_1q_2%7D%7Br_1%2Br_2%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0), where q is the charge and r is the relative atomic mass of an ion.  

This is no coincidence. We know that energy is proportional to force, and that the distance beween two atoms is proportional to their atomic radius, which is in turn proportional to their relative atomic mass.  

The lattice energy of an ionic compound is the amount of energy it takes to form all of the bonds within one mole of it. As the energy of bond-forming is just the negative energy of bond-breaking, we can conclude that the magnitude of the lattice energy of a compound is a measure of how easy it is to break its bonds. And, we can also conclude that **the easiness of bond-breaking is directly proportional to a compound's charge product, and inversely proportional to its ionic radius**.

In order for an ionic compound to be soluble in water, the energy released from ion-dipole interactions must be greater than the energy of hydrogen bonding and the lattice energy. Ion dipole interactions, being electrostatic interactions, can also be described with Coulomb's law.  

(We can regard the force, or energy, of ion-dipole interactions between water and different compound to be constant so that we can focus on how the lattice energy affects solubility.)

## Solubility Rules
1. Most ammonium and alkali metal salts are soluble.
2. Most halides, sulphates and nitrates are soluble, except for lead(II) and silver chloride, and barium, calcium, and lead(II) sulphate.
3. Most carbonates, phosphates, and hydroxides are insoluble, except for the ammonium and alkali metal salts, and calcium hydroxide.
4. All else is soluble.

'O' level students are often taught the above rules. But with our knowledge of lattice energies, we can now determine why these rules are so and if any extensions can be made. 

Let's start with the first rule. Ammonium ions have a high relative molecular mass (18 amu) and a low, unipositive charge. This means that salts with ammonium ions have a low lattice energy. But, ammonium isn't the only low-charge, polyatomic ion. Acetate, perchlorate, and nitrate solubles are all analogous to ammonium. With this, we can create an extension to the first rule, being:

**1. Most polyatomic, singly-charged ion salts (eg S2O3, NH4) are soluble.**

Using the lattice energy equation, it is trivial to see how alkali metal salts are soluble. As we've already used rule 1, we can form another rule:

**2. Most alkali metal salts are soluble.**

Let's move on to rule two. Halide and nitrate ions both have high masses and low-magnitude charges. Nitrates are relatively uncomplicated, so we'll leave that alone, but halides do form insoluble compounds, for reasons that cannot be explained with Coulomb's law. Therefore:

**3. Most nitrate salts are soluble.**

**4. Most halide salts are soluble, except for those with copper(I), lead(II), mercury(I), silver(I), thallium(I) cations.**

The sulphate ion is slightly different in that it has a charge-magnitude of two. The anion still has a high mass (96 amu), which means it can form soluble salts with most cations, but its high charge means that it can't form soluble salts with cations that have charges above one. This is why barium (Ba2+), calcium (Ca2+) and lead (Pb2+) can't form soluble salts with sulphate. (**N.B.** This is a bit misleading, in that there are many factors which come into play when determining bond strength. Aluminium, for instance, has a +3 charge and a low mass but can form a soluble salt with sulphate.)

One more ion which is able to form bonds with sulphate is strontium. Therefore:

**5. Most sulphate salts are soluble, except for those with calcium, barium, lead(II) and strontium cations.**

Rule three is easy enough. Carbonates (CO3 2-), phosphates (PO4 3-), and hydroxides (OH-), have a high charge-mass ratio, and typically form insoluble salts. However, the first and second rules take precedent over insolubility rules. Also, because reasons, calcium[1] and barium hydroxides are soluble. Therefore:  

**6. Carbonates, phosphates, and hydroxides are insoluble, except for calcium and barium hydroxides.**

The last rule is a tricky one to tackle, because it's very wrong. The rules we've made cover most soluble cations and anions that *can possibly* form soluble salts, barring some. Most other ions and their compounds have lattice energies too high to be dissolved. The rule we should instead use is:  

**7. Most other salts are insoluble.**

Combining the rules we've made, we obtain five, simple-to-remember, easy-to-understand rules.
1. Most polyatomic, singly-charged ion salts are soluble, except for hydroxide salts. (Calcium and barium hydroxides are soluble.)
2. Most alkali metal salts are soluble.
3. Most halide salts are soluble, except for those with copper(I), lead(II), mercury(I), silver(I), thallium(I) cations.
4. Most sulphate salts are soluble, except for those with calcium, barium, lead(II) and strontium cations.
5. Most other salts are insoluble.

## The Solubility Constant

## Summary & Conclusions
1. Most polyatomic, singly-charged ion salts are soluble, except for hydroxide salts. (Calcium and barium hydroxides are soluble.)
2. Most alkali metal salts are soluble.
3. Most halide salts are soluble, except for those with copper(I), lead(II), mercury(I), silver(I), thallium(I) cations.
4. Most sulphate salts are soluble, except for those with calcium, barium, lead(II) and strontium cations.
5. Most other salts are insoluble.
