# Solubility
In secondary school, we memorize solubility rules without really understanding why. Even post-secondary, some of us chemistry students don't know what makes an ionic compound soluble. In this set of notes, I aim to provide a physical and chemical basis for the rules of solubility of ionic compounds.
