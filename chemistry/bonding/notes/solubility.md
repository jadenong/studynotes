# Solubility
In secondary school, we memorize solubility rules without really understanding why. Even post-secondary, some of us chemistry students still don't know what makes an ionic compound soluble. In this set of notes, I aim to provide a physical and chemical basis for the rules of solubility of ionic compounds.
## Coulomb's Law
![](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1594356158/render.png), where q is the charge and r is the radius of an electrostatically charged object, and where k is a constant.  

This is Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law describes the force of attraction (or repulsion) between two electrostatically charged objects, like ions or electrodes. You might notice that this is quite similar to the the lattice energy equation:  
![](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%7C%5Ctext%7BLattice%20Energy%7D%7C%20%5Cpropto%20%5Cfrac%7Bq_1q_2%7D%7Br_1%2Br_2%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0), where q is the charge and r is the relative atomic mass of an ion.  

This is no coincidence. We know that energy is proportional to force, and that the distance beween two atoms is proportional to their atomic radius, which is in turn proportional to their relative atomic mass.  

The lattice energy of an ionic compound is the amount of energy it takes to form all of the bonds within one mole of it. As the energy of bond-forming is just the negative energy of bond-breaking, we can conclude that the magnitude of the lattice energy of a compound is a measure of how easy it is to break its bonds. And, we can also conclude that **the easiness of bond-breaking is directly proportional to a compound's charge product, and inversely proportional to its ionic radius**.

In order for an ionic compound to be soluble in water, the energy released from ion-dipole interactions must be greater than the energy of hydrogen bonding and the lattice energy. Ion dipole interactions, being electrostatic interactions, can also be described with Coulomb's law.  

## Solubility Rules
1. Most ammonium and alkali metal salts are soluble.
2. Most halides, sulphates and nitrates are soluble, except for lead(II) and silver chloride, and barium, calcium, and lead(II) sulphate.
3. Most carbonates, phosphates, and hydroxides are insoluble, except for the ammonium and alkali metal salts, and calcium and magnesium hydroxides (which are sparingly soluble).
4. All else is soluble.

'O' level students are often taught the above rules. But with our knowledge of lattice energies, we can now determine why these rules are so and if any extensions can be made. 

Let's start with the first rule. Ammonium ions have a high relative molecular mass (18 amu) and a low, unipositive charge. This means that salts with ammonium ions have a low lattice energy. Likewise, alkali metals typically have a high mass and a low charge (an exception being Lithium, whose salts are not as soluble). But, ammonium isn't the only low-charge, polyatomic ion. Acetate, perchlorate, and nitrate solubles are all analogous to ammonium. With this, we can create an extension to the first rule, being:
**1. Most polyatomic, singly-charged ion salts (eg S2O3, NH4) are soluble.  
2. Most alkali metal salts are soluble.**  

(We can regard the force, or energy, of ion-dipole interactions between water and different compound to be constant so that we can focus on how the lattice energy affects solubility.)
