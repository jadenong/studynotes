# Problems in Practical Planning

Construct plans for the following experiments:

* Determine the enthalpy change of the reaction between copper metal and sulfuric acid (1.00 mol per litre) in aqueous medium.
* Determine the enthalpy change of the reaction between potassium bicarbonate and potassium hydroxide in aqueous medium.
* Determine the concentration of sodium chlorate (I) and the enthalpy change of the reaction between sodium chlorate, sodium hydroxide, and sodium thiosulfate.

Answers:
* (Copper metal is unreactive with sulfuric acid, so an alternative pathway must be found). ![Include Hess' Law here](). 

Using a 25.0cm<sup>3</sup> pippete, measure out 25.0cm<sup>3</sup> of sulfuric acid. Amount of sulfuric acid in the volume obtained equals 0.025 mol. 

Add the sulfuric acid to a styrofoam cup supported in a 250cm<sup>3</sup> beaker. ![sulfuric acid congruent copper metal]() Weigh accurately 1.00g of magnesium metal in a clean dry stoppered weighing bottle. ![Cu molar mass times amount]() 

Measure the temperature of the solution in cup and start the stopwatch. Continue measuring the temperature at half-minute intervals for two minutes. Add the 2.5 minute mark, add the magnesium metal into the acid and stir. Continue measuring the temperature at half-minute intervals until the temperature remains constant. Stir throughout. 

Weigh the weighing bottle containing the residual magnesium and calculate the mass of magnesium used.
