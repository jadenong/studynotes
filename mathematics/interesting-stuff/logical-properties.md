# The Logical Properties of Arithmetic
The addition and multiplication of real numbers are governed by a set of properties. These properties are of **associativity**, **commutativity**, and **distributivity**.

## Associativity
### Arithmetic
When we say something an operator is associative, in a string of operations, we do not care which operation we do first, second, or third. No matter which operation we do when, as long as we do them correctly, we will get the same result.

An example of an associative operation is addition.

We can see from the above equations that it does not matter which addition we do first. Unlike in subtraction, where we have to do things left-to-right, we can add numbers in the order we please.

Subtraction is not an associative operation, and we must take care to do things left-to-right and follow the so-called order of operations.

The above equation shows exactly why subtraction is not an associative operation â€” doing things willy-nilly will result in totally different results! 

Multiplication is also associative, while division is not.

## Commutativity
When we say something is commutative, we do not care whether we do the operation left-to-right or right-to-left. Either way, the result will be the same.

Addition and multiplication are examples of commutative operations. a + b is always equal to b + a. However, this is not the case with division, as shown below.

Subtraction is also an example of a non-commutative operation.

### Vectors
The cross product is an example of a non-commutative operator.

## Distributivity
We say that an operation is distributive when it does this:
