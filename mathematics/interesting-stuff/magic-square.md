# Magic Squares

A magic square is a square grid with numbers in it (think sudoku). These numbers follow a certain pattern. Let's start of with a certain number, n.  

Let's define n as the sum of all the numbers in the first row. We quickly discover that the sum of all the numbers in the second, third, and fourth (and so on) rows is equals to n. Not only that, the sum of all the numbers in each column is also n. The numbers in the four corner squares also sum to n and so does the four innermost squares in the centre of the magic square.
