We use the greek capital letter Sigma to denote a sum. Underneath Sigma lies a dummy variable, which we use to count the terms of x; above Sigma lies the last term which x should be counted to. The terms of all the x's are added together to form the sum. Beside Sigma, there is an x, which represents a term in a set of n terms.

Above is an example of a sum. In such a sum, each term is a function of i, with i beginning at three. In order to obtain the sum, we must first find the values of each term. When i hits 6, the number at the top, the summation stops.
