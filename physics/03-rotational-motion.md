# The Motion Of Rotating Objects
The motion of rotating objects is very different, though analogous from the motion of moving (or translating) objects. My aim in this set of notes is to describe the laws and applications of rotational objects.

## The Rotational Analogy
Translational motion is what we typically think of when the word 'motion' comes to mind, but there is another form of motion â€” that of spinning, or rotating, objects. We cannot use the terminology of translational rotation in describing rotational objects, for concepts such as position, velocity, and momentum are irrelevant in describing objects that are not 'actually moving'. Instead, we must come up with new terminology. Fortunately, much of the terminology used are analogous to those in translational motion, for instance, angular position, angular velocity, and angular momentum.

### Angular Displacement

Instead of using displacement in describing rotating objects, we use the term angular displacement. The angular displacement is the angle that a point has been rotated about a specific axis. And when we say 'axis', we refer to the line that a rotating object moves around. 

When we measure the angular displacement, we must also take into account direction, for an object can rotate either clockwise or anti-clockwise. In order to find the direction of rotation, we must use the so-called right-hand rule of rotational motion, which is not to be confused with the various other right-hand rules.

To use the right-hand rule, position your right hand such that the curve of your fingers is in the same direction that the object is rotating in. Then, if the thumb faces upward, the angular displacement is positive; and if the thumb faces downwards, the angular displacement is negative.

### Newton's Laws

Newton's laws of motion also have an analogy in rotational motion.

#### Newton's First Law of Rotational Motion

An object will remain at rest or spin at constant angular velocity unless acted upon by a net torque. 

#### Newton's Second Law of Rotational Motion

#### Newton's Third Law of Rotational Motion


## Rotating and Translating Objects

An object can rotate and move through space at the same time. In the case of projectile motion, the object's centre of mass will follow the path of a parabola, while the rest of the object will rotate about its centre of mass.
