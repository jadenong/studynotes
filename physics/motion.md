# Motion

What are the laws that govern moving objects? What properties do moving and stationary objects have? How can we quantify and make use of these laws? In this set of notes, I aim to provide an introduction to the laws and principles that govern motion.

## Newton's Laws

Around 350 years ago, there lived a scientist named Issac Newton who formulated three laws of motion. The laws are as follows.

### Newton's First Law  

#### An object will remain rest or at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net force.

This law is sometimes also known as the *Law of Inertia* as it describes that objects resist changes in motion. This resistance is known as inertia.

### Newton's Second Law  

#### The net force on an object equals its mass multiplied by its acceleration.

This instance of the law is sometimes described as a specific version of the 'real' second law, which is that the net force on an object is proportional to the rate of change of its momentum. (Linear momentum equals mass times velocity.)

By the constant multiple rule of derivatives, our original equation can be derived from the more general one, assuming mass is constant.

### Newton's Third Law  

#### When a body exerts a net force on another body, the second body will exert a force on the first body that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the first body.

This law is sometimes known by its slightly less precise definition: "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."

  i) Think of three examples, one for each law, where Newton's laws of motions have application.  
  
  ii) You are on a sled pulled by a dog, moving uphill on a mountain at constant speed. Assuming there is no frictional force, what the net force acting on you? Take the acceleration of gravity to be 10 ms<sup>-2</sup>, and your mass to be 60 kg.
